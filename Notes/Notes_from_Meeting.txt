                       Notes from Meeting:

1. Do an all by all pairwise hypergeometric test to figure out which pairs of events have significant overlap
	a. overlap
2. Study the structure of phylogentic tree algorithms in order to create a subsetting metric
3. Finish making notes on PEER (Look for ways to deal with confounders)
4. Split binary matrix into two matrices (one for upregulated and one for downregulated)

5. Make notes of the workflow
