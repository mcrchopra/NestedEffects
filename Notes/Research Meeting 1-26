1) DbScan - Convert Similarity Matrix to Distances
a) Theoretically give small communities of hyper-correlated event groups (Better Event Associations)
2) Logistic Regression (Regularizers and Penalties)
a) Filter Resultant Prediction Vectors by AUC (around 0.8)
3) Then apply to PANCANAtlas
4) Long Term: Use Connection of Event Associations to Create Markers that would be useful for patients
