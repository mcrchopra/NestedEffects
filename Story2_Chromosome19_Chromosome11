Amplification of miRNA (small piece of RNA) transcribed into protein
miRNA binds to longer parts of RNA (usually prevents binding and creation of proteins)
Regulational effect on genes on Chromosome 11?
Huge miRNA cluster on Chromosome 19q13
It will act in the same manner as deleting the gene
C19MC microRNA (look what genes they regulate)
Hypothesis to help patient outcome (drug prediction)
